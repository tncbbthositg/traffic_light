# Traffic Light

Welcome to the Traffic Light VS Code extension!!  Since you're spending most of your time in VS Code, this is a convenient place to update your busy status.

## Extension Settings

You have to have the Traffic Light installed on a Particle.io device.  You need to call `Set User Token` and `Set Particle Id` to get started.
Include if your extension adds any VS Code settings through the `contributes.configuration` extension point.
