# Traffic Light

This is my traffic light project.  With 5 kids living in my house, I was having a hard time making sure everyone knew when I was busy at work.  So, I started this project to create an office status indicator.

## Projects

There are three projects in this repo.

* `particle`: the Particle Photon firmware than runs the traffic light
* `models`: The 3D models for the traffic light enclosure
* `integrations`: The integrations with the particle.io API to control the traffic light
  * Currently, the VS Code extension is the only integration

## Hardware

* [WS2812B Strip](https://amzn.to/3TpgJ1s)
* [Particle Photon](https://store.particle.io/collections/wifi/products/photon-2)
* [Creality Ender 3](https://amzn.to/3ATZXRq)

## TODO

* Organize the code in the extension a little better
* An Alexa skill
* Updated readme
  * Better details
  * Photos
* Wiring diagram
